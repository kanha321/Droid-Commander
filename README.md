This app was developed to **demonstrate why developer options should remain disabled for normal users**. It highlights how enabling USB debugging and developer settings can allow external apps or users to:

- Access and modify files without user consent
- View and send SMS messages programmatically
- Make calls without device owner‚Äôs knowledge
- Install or uninstall apps silently
- Control system power operations
- Execute arbitrary shell commands through the integrated terminal

Certain operations within Droid Commander **require root access** to execute privileged commands, especially for:

- Complete file system access
- Unrestricted app management operations
- Advanced power controls
